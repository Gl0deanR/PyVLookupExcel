You can simply use pyinstaller or something else to simply create a .exe (or what not) file and run it as it is. I've only tried it at the moment with .xlsx files so I don't know if it would work with .xls files too.

## How to use:
Run the script, complete all the information and click on "SEND" and close the first window, then another window will appear showing a success message, close that one too and that's all. Open your desired file and the information will be filled in.
